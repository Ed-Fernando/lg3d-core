This directory, and its subdirectories stores the package listings for the 
javadoc for the extension libraries. The listings are provided so that
offline generation of javadoc can be performed, with links to the relevant
javadoc for third-party libraries.

To build the javadoc run the 'javadoc' ant target. e.g. 'ant javadoc' in the
lg3d-core directory.

The resulting javadoc is in the lg3d-core/release/docs/javadoc/api directory.
