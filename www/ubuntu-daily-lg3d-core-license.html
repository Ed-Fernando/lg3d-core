<br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
<br>
Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307, USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share<br>
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to<br>
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to<br>
make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License<br>
applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any
other<br>
program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software<br>
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License<br>
instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our<br>
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to<br>
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you<br>
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can<br>
change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
you <br>
know<br>
you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to <br>
deny<br>
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions<br>
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
of the<br>
software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or <br>
for a<br>
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
must make<br>
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you<br>
must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) <br>
offer<br>
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or<br>
modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that<br>
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.
If the<br>
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its<br>
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
<br>
problems<br>
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We <br>
wish<br>
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually<br>
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To<br>
prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for<br>
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification<br>
follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice<br>
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
terms of<br>
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any<br>
such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either
the <br>
Program<br>
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing<br>
the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with<br>
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, <br>
translation<br>
is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
licensee is<br>
addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not <br>
covered by<br>
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is <br>
not<br>
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its<br>
contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been <br>
made<br>
by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
Program <br>
does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as<br>
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and <br>
appropriately<br>
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and<br>
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License<br>
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
the <br>
Program<br>
a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you <br>
may at<br>
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, <br>
thus<br>
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such <br>
modifications<br>
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you<br>
also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified
files to carry prominent notices stating<br>
that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that
you distribute or publish, that in <br>
whole<br>
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be<br>
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program
normally reads commands interactively <br>
when run,<br>
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
most<br>
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or<br>
else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
redistribute the<br>
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of this License. (Exception:
if the Program itself is <br>
interactive but<br>
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the <br>
Program is<br>
not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable<br>
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
reasonably<br>
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this<br>
License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute <br>
them<br>
as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of
a <br>
whole<br>
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the<br>
whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other<br>
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part <br>
regardless<br>
of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your<br>
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the<br>
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based <br>
on the<br>
Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with <br>
the<br>
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
or<br>
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope<br>
of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under <br>
Section<br>
2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above<br>
provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete
corresponding machine-readable source<br>
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written
offer, valid for at least three <br>
years, to<br>
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically<br>
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of <br>
Sections 1<br>
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the
information you received as to the offer to<br>
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
for<br>
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
object<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b<br>
above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making<br>
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means
all <br>
the<br>
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface<br>
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and <br>
installation<br>
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code <br>
distributed<br>
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source<br>
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself<br>
accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to <br>
copy<br>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source <br>
code<br>
from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even<br>
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the <br>
object<br>
code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as<br>
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify,<br>
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically<br>
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received<br>
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses<br>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.<br>
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
<br>
Program<br>
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you<br>
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
<br>
Program<br>
(or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this <br>
License<br>
to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,<br>
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program),<br>
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to<br>
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and<br>
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients'<br>
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing<br>
compliance by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent <br>
infringement<br>
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
imposed<br>
on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that<br>
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the<br>
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy<br>
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent<br>
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
at all.<br>
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free <br>
redistribution of<br>
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly<br>
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License <br>
would<br>
be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any<br>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply <br>
and the<br>
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or<br>
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
this<br>
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software<br>
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.
Many<br>
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software<br>
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to<br>
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that<br>
choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a<br>
consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain<br>
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original <br>
copyright<br>
holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit<br>
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that<br>
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
In <br>
such<br>
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of <br>
this<br>
License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the<br>
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in<br>
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address<br>
new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program <br>
specifies<br>
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version",<br>
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of<br>
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software <br>
Foundation.<br>
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you
may <br>
choose<br>
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs<br>
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask
for<br>
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software<br>
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make <br>
exceptions<br>
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free<br>
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting<br>
the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY <br>
FOR THE<br>
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE<br>
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE
THE <br>
PROGRAM<br>
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING,<br>
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS <br>
FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE<br>
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
<br>
COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL<br>
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE<br>
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br>
GENERAL,<br>
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR<br>
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
OR <br>
