  If you are interested in developing 3D applications, we encourage you to check out 
  <a href="https://wonderland.dev.java.net/index.html">Project Wonderland</a>. It was
  founded by some of the core members of Looking Glass. Like Looking Glass, you can use
  Wonderland to develop 3D applications and integrate X11 applications into the 3D world.
  One extra cool thing about Wonderland is that it is collaborative--you can interact with
  other people in a virtual world, communicating via voice, text, video, images, and applications.
  Come visit!

What if your desktop was actually a 3D environment?
What if your CD or movie database became a 3D jukebox?

Project Looking Glass is based on Java technology and explores
bringing a richer user experience to the desktop and applications via
3D windowing and visualization capabilities. It is an open
source development project based on and evolved from Sun Microsystems'
Advanced Development division. It supports running unmodified
existing applications in a 3D space, as well as APIs for 3D window
manager and application development. At the moment, existing
application integration is supported for Linux and Solaris x86 platforms.
The platform for 3D application development is available for Linux,
Solaris and Windows platforms.

<p>
Project Looking Glass is in its infancy.
We need your help to explore many ideas in the desktop and application space.
We released the Project Looking Glass code to the whole community
to explore every aspect of the technology rather than restricting access
to a privileged few. We believe open development is an excellent model
to pursue this exciting and vast opportunity.
So get involved and let's innovate the computer user interface!
</p>

<p>
Java technology is the primary development language. We believe
it is a good choice especially because of the productivity gains it
brings and the rich set of supporting API's we can draw on.  Having
said that we are planning C++ bindings so native applications can
interact directly with the system.
