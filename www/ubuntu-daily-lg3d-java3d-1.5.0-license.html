software to interoperate with any program(s) other than Software. (i)<br>
Software may contain programs that perform automated collection of<br>
system data and/or automated software updating services. System data<br>
collected through such programs may be used by Sun, its subcontractors,<br>
and its service delivery partners for the purpose of providing you with<br>

<br>
6. Java Compatibility and Open Source.<br>
<br>

classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under<br>
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available<br>
at www.java.net.<br>
<br>
Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source<br>
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions<br>
and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of<br>
its products.<br>
<br>
Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and<br>
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern<br>
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter<br>
any rights and obligations you may have under such open source licenses,<br>
however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions<br>
in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution.<br>
<br>
7. Term and Termination.<br>
<br>
The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your<br>
rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from<br>
Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's<br>
and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement<br>
should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to<br>
become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or<br>
trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of,<br>
and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections<br>
1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.<br>
<br>
8. Limited Warranty.<br>
<br>
Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of<br>
purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which<br>
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials<br>
and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is<br>
provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under<br>
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media<br>
or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations<br>
on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This<br>
limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others,<br>
which vary from state to state.<br>
<br>
9. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,<br>
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT<br>
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO<br>
BE LEGALLY INVALID.<br>
<br>
10. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS<br>
BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS<br>
OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF<br>
OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you,<br>
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed<br>
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing<br>
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its<br>
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental<br>
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable<br>
to you.<br>
<br>
11. Export Regulations.<br>
<br>
All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered<br>
under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be<br>
subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree<br>
to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that<br>
you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export,<br>
or import as may be required after delivery to you.<br>
<br>
12. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.<br>
<br>
If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or<br>
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),<br>
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation<br>
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with<br>
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)<br>
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).<br>
<br>
13. Governing Law.<br>
<br>
Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California<br>
law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any<br>
jurisdiction will apply.<br>
<br>
14. Severability.<br>
<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this<br>
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless<br>
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this<br>
Agreement will immediately terminate.<br>
<br>
15. Integration.<br>
<br>
This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the<br>
entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It<br>
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications,<br>
proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any<br>
conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or<br>
other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter<br>
during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will<br>
be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative<br>
of each party.<br>
