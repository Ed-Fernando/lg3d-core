7.1 Licensee acknowledges that Licensed Software may 
contain errors and is not designed, licensed, or 
intended for use in the design, construction, 
operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility 
("HighRisk Activities"). Sun disclaims any express or 
implied warranty of fitness for such uses. Licensee 
represents and warrants to Sun that it will not use, 
distribute or license the Licensed Software for High 
Risk Activities.  

7.2 LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". ALL EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND 
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE 
DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISCLAIMERS 
ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

<p>8.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY </p>

8.1 Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed Software 
may be experimental and that the Licensed Software may 
have defects or deficiencies, which cannot or will not 
be corrected by Sun. Licensee will hold Sun harmless 
from any claims based on Licensee's use of the 
Licensed Software for any purposes other than those of 
internal evaluation, and from any claims that later 
versions or releases of any Licensed Software 
furnished to Licensee are incompatible with the 
Licensed Software provided to Licensee under this 
Agreement.  

8.2 To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event 
will Sun be liable for any indirect, punitive, 
special, incidental or consequential damage in 
connection with or arising out of this Agreement 
(including loss of business, revenue, profits, use,

9.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS If this Software 
is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. 
Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or

rights in the Software and accompanying documentation 
shall be only as set forth in this license; this is in 
accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-4 (for Department 
of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 
2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

<p>10.0 GENERAL TERMS </p>

10.1 Any action relating to or arising out of this

comply strictly with all such laws and regulations and 
acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain 
such licenses to export, re-export or import as may be 
required after delivery to Licensee.  

10.3 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding 
any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's 
breach of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable 
damage for which recovery of money damages would be 
inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to 
seek timely injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights 
under this Agreement in addition to any and all 
remedies available at law.  

10.4 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer 
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement,

relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all 
prior or contemporaneous oral or written 
communications, proposals, conditions, representations 
and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or 
additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, 
or other communication between the parties relating to 
its subject matter, including any Binary Code 
Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other licenses 
contained within Licensed Software. No modification to 
this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and

governed by the terms of the license below:<BR><BR>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
LICENSE<BR><BR>Version 2, June 1991<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991
Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>59 Temple Place - Suite 330,
Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA<BR><BR>Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies<BR>of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.<BR><BR>Preamble<BR><BR>The licenses for most
software are designed to take away your freedom to share<BR>and
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to<BR>guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to<BR>make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License<BR>applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other<BR>program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software<BR>Foundation software
is covered by the GNU Library General Public License<BR>instead.) You
can apply it to your programs, too.<BR><BR>When we speak of free
software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our<BR>General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to<BR>distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you<BR>wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can<BR>change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you <BR>know<BR>you can do these
things.<BR><BR>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to <BR>deny<BR>you these rights or to ask you to
surrender the rights. These restrictions<BR>translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the<BR>software,
or if you modify it.<BR><BR>For example, if you distribute copies of
such a program, whether gratis or <BR>for a<BR>fee, you must give the
recipients all the rights that you have. You must make<BR>sure that
they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you<BR>must show
them these terms so they know their rights.<BR><BR>We protect your
rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) <BR>offer<BR>you
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or<BR>modify the software.<BR><BR>Also, for each author's
protection and ours, we want to make certain that<BR>everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If
the<BR>software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want
its<BR>recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any <BR>problems<BR>introduced by others will not reflect on the
original authors' reputations.<BR><BR>Finally, any free program is
threatened constantly by software patents. We <BR>wish<BR>to avoid
the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually<BR>obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To<BR>prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for<BR>everyone's free use or not licensed at
all.<BR><BR>The precise terms and conditions for copying,
distribution and modification<BR>follow.<BR><BR>TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR><BR>0. This License
applies to any program or other work which contains a notice<BR>placed
by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
of<BR>this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any<BR>such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the
Program&quot; means either the <BR>Program<BR>or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing<BR>the Program
or a portion of it, either verbatim or with<BR>modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, <BR>translation<BR>is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
Each licensee is<BR>addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<BR><BR>Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not <BR>covered
by<BR>this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is <BR>not<BR>restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its<BR>contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been <BR>made<BR>by running the
Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program <BR>does.<BR><BR>1.
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as<BR>you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and <BR>appropriately<BR>publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and<BR>disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License<BR>and to the
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
<BR>Program<BR>a copy of this License along with the Program.<BR><BR>You
may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
<BR>may at<BR>your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.<BR><BR>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
any portion of it, <BR>thus<BR>forming a work based on the Program,
and copy and distribute such <BR>modifications<BR>or work under the
terms of Section 1 above, provided that you<BR>also meet all of these
conditions:<BR><BR>a) You must cause the modified files to carry
prominent notices stating<BR>that you changed the files and the date
of any change.<BR><BR>b) You must cause any work that you distribute
or publish, that in <BR>whole<BR>or in part contains or is derived
from the Program or any part thereof, to be<BR>licensed as a whole at
no charge to all third parties under the terms<BR>of this
License.<BR><BR>c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively <BR>when run,<BR>you must cause it, when started
running for such interactive use in the most<BR>ordinary way, to
print or display an announcement including an<BR>appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or<BR>else,
saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
the<BR>program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
view a<BR>copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
<BR>interactive but<BR>does not normally print such an announcement,
your work based on the <BR>Program is<BR>not required to print an
announcement.)<BR><BR>These requirements apply to the modified work
as a whole. If identifiable<BR>sections of that work are not derived
from the Program, and can be reasonably<BR>considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this<BR>License, and its terms, do
not apply to those sections when you distribute <BR>them<BR>as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of
a <BR>whole<BR>which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
of the<BR>whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other<BR>licensees extend to the entire whole, and
thus to each and every part <BR>regardless<BR>of who wrote it.<BR><BR>Thus,
it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your<BR>rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to exercise the<BR>right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based <BR>on the<BR>Program.<BR><BR>In addition,
mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
<BR>the<BR>Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume
of a storage or<BR>distribution medium does not bring the other work
under the scope<BR>of this License.<BR><BR>3. You may copy and
distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under <BR>Section<BR>2)
in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above<BR>provided that you also do one of the following:<BR><BR>a)
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source<BR>code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a<BR>medium customarily used for software
interchange; or,<BR><BR>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid
for at least three <BR>years, to<BR>give any third party, for a
charge no more than your cost of physically<BR>performing source
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the<BR>corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of <BR>Sections 1<BR>and
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or,<BR><BR>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to
the offer to<BR>distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for<BR>noncommercial distribution and
only if you received the program in object<BR>code or executable form
with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b<BR>above.)<BR><BR>The
source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making<BR>modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all <BR>the<BR>source code for all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface<BR>definition files, plus the
scripts used to control compilation and <BR>installation<BR>of the
executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
<BR>distributed<BR>need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source<BR>or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself<BR>accompanies the executable.<BR><BR>If distribution of
executable or object code is made by offering access to <BR>copy<BR>from
a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source <BR>code<BR>from the same place counts as distribution of the
source code, even<BR>though third parties are not compelled to copy
the source along with the <BR>object<BR>code.<BR><BR>4. You may not
copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
as<BR>expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify,<BR>sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
will automatically<BR>terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received<BR>copies, or rights, from you
under this License will not have their licenses<BR>terminated so long
as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR><BR>5.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You are not required to accept this
License, since you have not signed it.<BR>However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the <BR>Program<BR>or
its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you<BR>do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
<BR>Program<BR>(or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this <BR>License<BR>to do so, and all its terms and
conditions for copying,<BR>distributing or modifying the Program or
works based on it.<BR><BR>6. Each time you redistribute the Program
(or any work based on the Program),<BR>the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to<BR>copy, distribute
or modify the Program subject to these terms and<BR>conditions. You
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'<BR>exercise
of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing<BR>compliance by third parties to this License.<BR><BR>7.
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<BR>infringement<BR>or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed<BR>on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that<BR>contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the<BR>conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy<BR>simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent<BR>obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all.<BR>For example, if a patent license
would not permit royalty-free <BR>redistribution of<BR>the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly<BR>through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
<BR>would<BR>be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.<BR><BR>If any portion of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable under any<BR>particular circumstance, the balance of
the section is intended to apply <BR>and the<BR>section as a whole is
intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR><BR>It is not the
purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or<BR>other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this<BR>section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software<BR>distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many<BR>people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software<BR>distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she
is willing to<BR>distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that<BR>choice.<BR><BR>This section is
intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a<BR>consequence of the rest of this License.<BR><BR>8. If the
distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain<BR>countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original <BR>copyright<BR>holder who places the Program under
this License may add an explicit<BR>geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that<BR>distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
<BR>such<BR>case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of <BR>this<BR>License.<BR><BR>9. The Free
Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the<BR>General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in<BR>spirit to the present version, but may differ
in detail to address<BR>new problems or concerns.<BR><BR>Each version
is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program <BR>specifies<BR>a
version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;,<BR>you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of<BR>that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software <BR>Foundation.<BR>If the Program does
not specify a version number of this License, you may <BR>choose<BR>any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<BR><BR>10. If
you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs<BR>whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for<BR>permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software<BR>Foundation, write to the Free Software
Foundation; we sometimes make <BR>exceptions<BR>for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
free<BR>status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting<BR>the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR><BR>NO
WARRANTY<BR><BR>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE,
THERE IS NO WARRANTY <BR>FOR THE<BR>PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE<BR>STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE <BR>PROGRAM<BR>&quot;AS
IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING,<BR>BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS <BR>FOR A<BR>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<BR>PROGRAM IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE <BR>COST
OF<BR>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR><BR>12. IN NO
EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL<BR>ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE<BR>PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY <BR>GENERAL,<BR>SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR<BR>INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR <BR>DATA<BR>BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
A<BR>FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH <BR>HOLDER<BR>OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR><BR>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</P>
