A.	DESCRIPTION


This README describes a splashscreen, executed at start-up. - Operational within both the ./lg3d-dev and 
the ./lg3d-session environments. 
Upon first run of Project Looking Glass after an 'ant' compile, a SplashDefaults.XML file is created in the 
src/devscripts directory. This default-set display consists of a pre-configured image and a text message, 
lasting for three seconds. For the purpose of personalisation, user preferences can be made to this xml file.


B.	CONFIGURING


If a user wishes, changes can be made to this XML file in order to make Project Looking Glass more personal.
Although the XML file is self explanatory, the four settings are :
 
1. runSplash - A means to turn on/off the splashscreen (default = true)
2. showText - A means to turn on/off the display message option. (default = true)
3. imageLocation - The location of the image to be displayed (default = resources/images/splash/GrandSplash.png)
4. messageText - The text greeting to be displayed, if showText, above is set to <true> (default = "Welcome.")

PLEASE NOTE: 

In order to change the values within the XML file, it must be done as user <root> or by changing the permissions.
To return all settings to default, or to fix a corrupted file, just delete the XML file and re-run PLG.


C.	ISSUES


If running the commands '  ant ' or '  ant clean  ' whilst the src/devscripts directory contains the SplashDefaults.XML
file, the ant compiler will print to screen the following error :

unpack-x
[chmod] /bin/chmod : changing permissions of ./../devscripts/SplashDefaults.xml : operation not permitted
[chmod] Result : 1

This error will not cause the build to fail for any reason and can be ignored. Deletion of the XML file will clear the error
but will mean re-configuration to your settings.
