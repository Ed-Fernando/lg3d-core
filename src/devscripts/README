Scripts for running tests, without requiring the jar to be built.

lg3d-session : starts the full Project Looking Glass session including
               the X server. Client applications in other processes
               can connect to the server. X11 applications will be
               'captured' and displayed fully integrated in the 3D
               environment.

lg3d-dev     : starts the Project Looking Glass environment in a window
               on an existing desktop. No support for X11 application is
               provided within the Looking Glass environment in this mode.
               The script can be given a parameter which be interpreted as
               name of the lgconfig file in etc/lg3d, if no parameter is
               supplied lgconfig_1p_nox.xml is used.

               Looking Glass aware applications in other processes can
               still connect to the server.

HelloUniverse : A sample script that combines an application and the
               Looking Glass environment in a single process. Use this
               mode for app development, scene manager development or
               low level platform testing. The environment is again run
               in a window on an existing desktop.
