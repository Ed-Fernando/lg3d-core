/**
 * The PolygonAttributes object defines attributes for rendering polygon
 * primitives.
 * Polygon primitives include triangles, triangle strips, triangle fans,
 * and quads.
 * The polygon attributes that can be defined are:</li>
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>Rasterization mode - defines how the polygon is drawn: as points,
 * outlines, or filled.<p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>POLYGON_POINT - the polygon is rendered as points
 * drawn at the vertices.</li><p>
 * <li>POLYGON_LINE - the polygon is rendered as lines
 * drawn between consecutive vertices.</li><p>
 * <li>POLYGON_FILL - the polygon is rendered by filling the interior
 * between the vertices. The default mode.</li>
 * <p></ul>
 * <li>Face culling - defines which polygons are culled (discarded)
 * before they are converted to screen coordinates.<p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>CULL_NONE - disables face culling.</li>
 * <li>CULL_BACK - culls all back-facing polygons. The default.</li>
 * <li>CULL_FRONT - culls all front-facing polygons.</li>
 * <p></ul>
 * <li>Back-face normal flip - specifies whether vertex normals of
 * back-facing polygons are flipped (negated) prior to lighting. The
 * setting is either true, meaning to flip back-facing normals, or 
 * false. The default is false.</li>
 * <p>
 * <li>Offset - the depth values of all pixels generated by polygon
 * rasterization can be offset by a value that is computed for that 
 * polygon. Two values are used to specify the offset:</li><p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Offset bias - the constant polygon offset that is added to 
 * the final device coordinate Z value of polygon primitives.</li>
 * <p>
 * <li>Offset factor - the factor to be multiplied by the
 * slope of the polygon and then added to the final, device coordinate
 * Z value of the polygon primitives.</li><p>
 * </ul>
 * These values can be either positive or negative. The default
 * for both of these values is 0.0.<p>
 * </ul>
