  The X11 Window Integration module, which implements plumbing for 
  communication between X server and SceneManager regarding application
  execution status.  This part doesn't include X client visual capture 
  integration, which can be found in the displayserver/fws/x11 directory.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes in this directory implements the following interfaces for
  X11 native window integration:
    <ul>
      <li><code>IntegrationModule</code></li>
      <li><code>NativeWindowControl</code></li>
    </ul>
  And use the following interface in order to send notification to the 3D
  window manager side:
    <ul>
        <li><code>NativeWindowMonitor</code></li>
    </ul>
  <code>NativeWindowLookAndFeel</code> implements this interface and
  leaves all the method as abstract, so that extended look and feel
  code will supply actions for the window management events.
  Please note that the interfaces are very primitive at this moment
  and still evolving.
  </p>
    
  <p>
  In order to implement reuqired features, this module includes a simple
  X Window Manager.  The window manager is fully written in Java on top
  of a Java X11 library called Escher.  Special thanks to Stephen Tse
  for creating such a wonderful technology!
  </p>

  The following diagram illustrates interaction between the 3D world
  and the X11 native window world.

                                                        moved.
                                               * how best we can distinguish
                                                 this from the following case?
                                                 Or, always performing a long 
                                                 round trip would be fine?

  Resize works in a similar manner.  However, note thatt there is 
  an additional complication because of necessary texture size change.
