  The LG Native Window Integration utility classes.
  </p>

  <p>
  [Need Paul's review]
  The two primary design goals are (1) allow pluggable Look and Feel, 
  (2) encapsulate complexity around native window caputure and communication.
  The classes in this package tries to abstract and hide all the complexity
  around the native application visual caputure as well as necessary 
  communication with the application side.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <code>NativeWindow3D</code> is the top level class with which
  <code>SceneManager</code> interact.  It extends <code>Frame3D</code>
  and behaves just like another 3D application.
  It also implements the methods declared in <code>NativeWindowMonitor</code>,
  which are used for the native 2D window manager to give notifications
  about status changes, etc.  The implementation, in turn, uses 
  <code>NativeWindowControl</code> interface to communicate back to the
  native window manager in order to perform actions against the 2D application
  associated with this object. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <code>NativeWindowLookAndFeel</code> defines native windows look and feel.
  At this level, typically window decoration is constructed.
  The current implementation includes 
  <code>GlassyNativeWindowLookAndFeel</code> in the 
  <code>lg3d.scenemanager.utils.decoration</code> package as an example.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  <code>NativeWindowObject</code> and <code>TiledNativeWindowImage</code>
  are introduced to hide all the complexy related to native window caputure
  support.  Texture is used for presenting captured 2D window surface in the
  3D space, but it has size limitation which is sometimes smaller than 
  maximum 2D window size.  In order to deal with large 2D window caputre,
  we use composite multiple textures created from multiple 
  <code>ImageComponent2D</code>s.  The details are hidden under this and
  the <code>TiledNativeWindowImage</code> class.

  The following diagram illustrates relationship among the major classes.
