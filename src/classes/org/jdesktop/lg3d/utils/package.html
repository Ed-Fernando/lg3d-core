  The LG utility classes.
  <p>
  Efforts have been paid to provide modular and reusable library.
  At this moment, the main focus of development is on rich visual feedback
  and features to support it, including utilities for event capture and
  visual actions.
  The following diagram shows relationship among classes in the
  subpackages related to visual feedback:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
  LgEvent
     |
     V
  eventadapter        actionadapter   action     behavior           smoother
  LgEventListener -> [Action*     ]-> Action* -> ActionBehavior <-> TransitionSmoother
                                                      |
                                                      V
                                                 Component3D (typically)
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the eventadapter subpackage implement the LgEventListener 
  interface and takes a class that implements one or more of the Action* 
  interface.  These are receiver of events and invokes performAction() 
  methods with pre-digested info.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the actionadapter subpackage implement the Action* interface
  and takes a class that implements one or more of the Action* interface.
  These act as converter among action types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the action subpackage implement one of more Action* interfaces.
  These receives pre-digested info typically from an eventadapter class
  via performAction() method invocation, and typically perform visual action. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the behavior subpackage extend the ActionBehavior abstract class
  and implement basic behaviors.  All the behaviors are executed on the server
  side.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the smoother subpackage implement either FloatTransitionSmoother
  or Vector3fTransitionSmoother.  These are designed to provide reusable 
  natural motion for action implementation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  There are a few more subpackages under the utils pacakge.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the eventaction subpackage typically receive event and performs
  action.  These are something reusable as a whole, thus haven't been componentized.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the shape subpackage typically extend the Shape3D class and 
  provides reusable shapes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the cursor subpackage extend the Cursor3D class and provides
  reusable 3D cursors.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the component subpackage extend either the Component3D or 
  Container3D class and implements reusable 3D components.  This area is still
  very rough.  Need more design work. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Classes under the layoutmanager subpackage implement the LayoutManager3D
  interface and provide reusable 3D layout manager.  This area is extremely
  rough.  Need more design work.
