  The new Animation system for Project Looking Glass. These animations provide
  a robust mechanism for describing multiple animations on a Component3D. 
  Multiple Animations can be added to a Component3D and they will combine to 
  create a single visual effect.
  </p>
  <p>
  The order in which Animations are added to a Component will effect the 
  resultant animation. For example 
                c3d.addAnimation( new TranslationAnimation(...) );
                c3d.addAnumation( new RotationAnimation(....) );
     will produce very different rendering from
                c3d.addAnumation( new RotationAnimation(....) );
                c3d.addAnimation( new TranslationAnimation(...) );
                
  Specifically each Animation operates on its own Matrix and each frame these
  matrices are multiplied together. The Animations are grouped in a stack, with
  first animation added being at the bottom of the stack, and closest to the leaf
  of the scene graph.
  
  TODO - generate an image showing the different results
