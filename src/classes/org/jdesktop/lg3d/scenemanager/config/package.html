  The system searches for configuration files *.lgcfg in the following
  order
       ~/.lg3d
       etc/lg3d/                  (actually this is in the jar)
       ../lg3d-demo-apps/config
       ../lg3d-incubator/config

  Each directory may contain multiple files and each file will contain one
  or more ConfigData objects. All files are scanned and the first occurance of 
  a SceneManagerConfig object will be used to create a SceneManager. 
 
  Once the SceneManager is created all other configuration data is injected 
  into the event system. The scene manager (and it's subcomponents) will have
  registered interest in the relevant config events as appropriate.
  
  Once all configuration data has been sent a ConfigurationCompleteEvent is
  posted. 
 
  Filenames have no relevance, although they do provide an ordering in which
  files are read.
  
  TODO  
     Veto config to stop configData being used
     Order config which controls the order things appear in lists/menus etc
