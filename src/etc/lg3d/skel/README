This etc/lg3d/skel/ directory is intended to be a place to store the default
configuration info for initializing the LG3D environment at the first run.

- prefs.xml -- this file contains the default LG3D preferences values.
  At the very first time startup of LG3D, those preferences are loaded 
  and stored by the JVM.  

  Once the preferences get loaded, this prefs.xml file won't be loaded
  again.  In order to force to do so, you can manually do like
  "rm -r ~/.java/.userPrefs/org/jdesktop/lg3d"
  TODO: we should provide some tool to manage the preferences.
