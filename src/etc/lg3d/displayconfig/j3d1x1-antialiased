// Set the TrackerBaseToImagePlate transform for this single screen.  This
// transforms points in tracker base coordinates to the screen's image plate
// coordinates, where the origin of the image plate is defined to be the lower
// left corner of the screen with X increasing to the right and Y increasing to
// the top.
//
// Without head or sensor tracking the tracker base is still needed as a point
// of reference for describing the orientation and position of each screen to
// the others.  When constructing a ConfiguredUniverse using a configuration
// file the coexistence to tracker base transform is set to identity by
// default, so the tracker base origin and orientation will also set the origin
// and orientation of coexistence coordinates in the physical world.
//
// Normally with a single screen and no tracking a configuration file would not
// be used, and coexistence coordinates would automatically be set up to map to
// the center of the screen (from the View's default coexistenceCenteringEnable
// value of true).  Since a configuration file is being used, the tracker base
// needs to be explicitly set to the center of the screen in order to place the
// center of coexistence there, so that ViewPlatform coordinates can be mapped
// to physical coordinates in a useful position.
